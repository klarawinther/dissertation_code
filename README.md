# dissertation_code
All Python code produced for my dissertation on classifying Scottish peatland conditions from Sentinel-2 data. This includes sampling Sentinel-2 data, then separating the data into different notebooks for multi-class and binary classifications. 

The folders named by year (2017-2023) contain individual sampling datasets for the peatland conditions present in those years. In 2017, for example, only one dataset was made corresponding to the one peatland condition sampled for a single AOI, whereas for 2018, several datasets were made corresponding to both different peatland conditions and different AOIs (each dataset is named accordingly).
